; I need to figure out how to code in 32 bit x86 lol 
; I am still very VERY new to the x86 ISA. I only took a very basic intro to cs architecture course in university
; which taught me about the ISA for the LC-3, which was suuppeer easy to understand. 
; the x86 ISA is a completely different beast lol. The Bootloader alone took me 3-4 days to understand and
; it's not even done :((
